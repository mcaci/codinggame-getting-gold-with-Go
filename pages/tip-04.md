Tip #4

Make your strategy easily readable

---

Unreadable strategy versus readable one

Use function with names that explain the strategy

Return an error to indicate that the strategy did not produce a valid result

Fallback to `"WAIT"` if no strategy works

A "WAIT" action is better than no action

You can lose game just by being disqualified for not providing an action at all
