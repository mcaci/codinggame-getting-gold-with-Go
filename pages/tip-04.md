# Summary

1. Use one pacakge per CodingGame difficulty level
2. Split code in different files when they get too long
3. Remember to aggregate all the code in one file before submitting into the arena

<br/>

### Bonus Tips

1. Do not create any common pacakges
2. Every difficulty level should keep the code for its own strategy
3. Copy and paste it common code across difficulty level when needed
