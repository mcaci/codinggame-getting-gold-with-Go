Tip #7

When in doubt, log

---
layout: center

Logging is your way to find bugs or explain an unclear action

---
layout: center
class: text-center

In CodingGame you log by printing to stderr with

`fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Message")`

`fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Message: %s\n", message)`

# Summary

Space reserved for reading logs is not huge, remember to clean them up and keep only the information

Append text after any command and that text will appear above your organism.
