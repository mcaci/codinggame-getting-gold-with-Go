# The objective of this tutorial

- And in this tutorial
- I will use Go to get to the Gold tier of a CodingGame Bot Programming challenge

---

# Why Go?

1. Simplicity
    - simple syntax to learn
    - easy and fast when writing the game logic
2. Fast runtime
    - compiler produces statically linked binary
    - runs directly on the target architecture of the runtime environment
    - garbage collector runs on a separate goroutine which barely affects the runtime performance
3. Readability
    - code formatted in the same way which makes it easy to read and update

# What tools are we going to use?

- __Go__ ([go.dev](https://go.dev))
  - Go provides a bundle with all of the tools needed, like the compiler and the standard library, needed in order to start an application
- An IDE
  - VScode with Go extension
- [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev)
  - Go's code documentation
- A [CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming) challenge
  - I'm going to use the 2022 Challenge: [Keep off the Grass](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/keep-off-the-grass-fall-challenge-2022)
