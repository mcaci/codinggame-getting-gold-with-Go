# Why Go?

1. Simplicity
    - simple syntax to learn
    - easy and fast when writing the game logic
2. Fast runtime
    - compiler produces statically linked binary
    - runs directly on the target architecture of the runtime environment
    - garbage collector runs on a separate goroutine which barely affects the runtime performance
3. Readability
    - code formatted in the same way which makes it easy to read and update
