Tip #5

Use functions as filters for your lists

---
layout: center

# A common situation

> I need a list of my elements

> I need a list of my elements only of type A

> I need a list of opponent elements only of type C

These are 3 different functions that produce a list of the same type but with different criterias

Use functions as the filters and you'll change all functions producing the same list to one function that produces the list and all of the others deciding which filter needs to be applied
