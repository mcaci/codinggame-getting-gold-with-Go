Tip #5

Use functions as filters for your lists

---

You often find yourselves in a situation like

> I need a list of my elements

> I need a list of my elements only of type A

> I need a list of opponent elements only of type C

These are 3 different functions that produce a list of the same type but with different criterias

Use functions as the filters and you'll change all functions producing the same list to one function that produces the list and all of the others deciding which filter needs to be applied

## Tip #5.1

Do not create any common pacakges

Every level should have its own strategy and the minimun code to make it work

When you need some code from the previous difficulty level, copy and paste it

You'll leave it open to modification should you need to update the code for the current level
